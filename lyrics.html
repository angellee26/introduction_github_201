        <p>I saw her in the rightest way</p>
        <p>Looking like Anne Hathaway</p>
        <p>Laughing while she hit her pen</p>
        <p>And coughed, and coughed</p>
        <p>And then, she came up to my knees</p>
        <p>Begging, baby, would you please?</p>
        <p>Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me</p> <br>

            <p>Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?</p>
            <p>And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?</p>
            <p>I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior</p>
            <p>My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in this favor</p>
            <p>I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long</p>
            <p>I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long</p>
